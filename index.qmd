## Collusion and cheating {.smaller}
- Collusion and cheating are serious offences and are likely to result in an unprofessionalism mark on your performance.
- As a lecturer, I believe in your ability to conduct yourself professionally and with integrity
- Collusion and cheating measures have been coded into the exam script, as decreed by the university.
- Given my belief in your abilities and integrity, I fully expect this measure to score zero.
- It is an open-book exam so you are allowed to refer to your notes and any other sources you see fit.
- Remember that directly quoting from any material is still plagiarism and classed as cheating by the QUB, so answer in your own voice.


## Tips

- Make sure you know how to export from Posit Cloud
- Manage you time based on the marks allocated
  - 10 for each  multiple choice question
  - 45 for each of the practice question
